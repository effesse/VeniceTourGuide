    <string name="basilica_description">The breathtaking Byzantine basilica dominating Piazza San Marco was constructed
        in such ornate fashion for two reasons: as an embodiment of the Venetian Republic’s power and as a fitting resting
        place for St Mark. Serving as the doges’ chapel, it was the site of coronations, funerals and processions,
        all gloriously framed by more than 4,000 sq m (43,000 sq ft) of mosaics, eastern treasures and 500 columns,
        some dating back to the 3rd century.
        \n1. Western Façade
        \nA marvellous succession of domes, columns, arches and spires, interspersed with marble statues,
        screens and glittering mosaics, greets tourists in Piazza San Marco. The northernmost arch houses
        13th-century mosaics that depict the basilica itself. Other mosaics are 17th- and 18th-century copies.
        \n2. Atrium Mosaics
        \nThese glorious mosaics of precious gold-leaf over glass tiles were created in the Byzantine tradition
        by expert craftsmen, and give detailed accounts of the Old Testament. The 13th-century cupola’s concentric
        circles recount 24 episodes from Genesis, including the Creation and Adam and Eve.
        \n3. Flooring
        \nThe elaborate paving is a mosaic masterpiece of multicoloured stones on uneven levels,
        evocative of the sea. Intricate geometrical designs sit alongside animal shapes.
        \n4. Pala d'Oro
        \nThe dazzling jewel-encrusted gold screen was commissioned in Constantinople in 976 but
        frequently added to at later dates. It boasts 250 panels bearing 1,927 authentic gems and cloisonné plaques.
        \n5. The Tetrarchs
        \nThe inspiration for these red porphyry rock figures is unknown.
        They probably represent the four emperors of the eastern and western Roman empires.
        The statue was pillaged from Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204.
        \n6.Treasury
        The basilica’s glittering riches include precious chalices of rock crystal enamelled
        by medieval silver- and goldsmiths and reliquaries from Venice’s eastern conquests,
        including parts of the True Cross.
        \n7.Ascension Dome
        The central dome has a spectacular array of early 13th-century mosaics, depicting the New Testament.
        Christ in Glory is shown above depictions of the Virtues.
